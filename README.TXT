This Inform 7 project file should allow you to compile Blue Lacuna and experiment with altering it on your own.

Blue Lacuna must be compiled with Inform build 5Z71. This can be downloaded from inform7.com. You may have problems getting the story to play in the "Game" panel with the built-in interpreter. Unchecking the "Release as blorb file" in the Settings panel may help with this; if not, you cal always Release the project and use an external interpreter.

Most of the code for Blue Lacuna is split into a series of extensions, included in the folder "Blue Lacuna Extensions." These must all be installed before the story will compile. The author will appear as "Blue Lacuna" so they will not clutter up your extensions list needlessly. One of these extensions, "Legacy Extensions for Blue Lacuna," is actually a compilation of all of the third-party extensions necessary, locked into a stable form: hopefully this will allow Blue Lacuna to still compile years hence when the current versions of these extensions have grown incompatible (as many already have).
